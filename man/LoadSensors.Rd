\arguments{
\item{setName}{Character. Name for the panel set to use.}

\item{species}{Character vector or NULL. Filter panels by species (e.g. "AT", "SL"). Default NULL (no filtering).}

\item{hormone}{Character vector or NULL. Filter panels by hormone (e.g. "aux", "cyt") category. Default NULL (no filtering).}

\item{type}{Character vector or NULL. Filter panels by type (e.g. "cis", "trans"). Default NULL (no filtering).}

\item{defaultPanels}{Logical. Whether to include default panels from package data. Default TRUE.}

\item{customPanels}{Logical. Whether to include custom panels from a local "iSensors/" folder. Default FALSE.}

\item{random}{Logical. Whether to add random gene panels automatically. Default TRUE.}

\item{randomInfo}{List or NULL. Custom settings for random gene panels; must contain fields 'n', 'sizes', 'majortrend'. Overrides `random` if provided.}

\item{metaPanels}{List or NULL. Meta panels with custom aggregation rules. Each element must be a list with 'srcPanels' (character vector) and 'rule' (function).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{iSensorsPanelSet}, a list containing the loaded panels and additional metadata.
}
\description{
Loads gene sensor panels from default package data and optionally from custom directories,
allowing filtering by species, hormone, and panel type. Supports adding random gene panels
and meta panels with custom aggregation rules.
}
\details{
The function loads gene sensor panels stored as `.rda` files under the package's `extdata/geneSensors` folder,
filtering files by species, hormone, and type when specified. Custom panels can be loaded from a folder named `iSensors`
in the working directory.

Random panels are generated by sampling gene names from the expression dataset, useful for statistical control.
Meta panels combine multiple existing panels with user-defined aggregation rules.
